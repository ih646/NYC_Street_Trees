# NYC_Street_Trees
This was one of my final projects for my data structures class that made almost complete use of all the material that I learned in that class. It required extensive use of Object Oriented design, implementation of the binary tree data structure and JUnit testing. The main csv file contained data from over a hundred thousand tree but unfortunately was too big to upload on github so I included the test CSV files instead.

#How to Run
The main file is NYC
